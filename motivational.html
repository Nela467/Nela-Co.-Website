    <div class="paragraph-card">
        Wellness isn’t a destination—it’s a practice. Each choice you make, from what you eat to how you move and breathe, builds the life you want. Today, choose one act that honors your body and your peace.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-card">
        Stress is natural, but it doesn’t define you. Pause, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that you have the power to reset.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-card">
        Balance is not about doing everything perfectly; it’s about making space for what nourishes you. Even small steps matter.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-card">
        Your body is your home, your mind your guide. Treat both with respect, patience, and kindness. Health begins with awareness.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph-card highlight">
        Every morning is a chance to begin again. Let go of yesterday’s burdens and focus on actions that uplift and sustain you today.
