    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone!
    I created Nela & Co, - Rise to Balance because I believe wellness is not about perfection - it is about connection, growth, and balance in every part of life.
    This page is my little corner of the internet where health, mindfulness, and movement meet in a waythat is real, practical, & uplifting.
        
    Here you will find:
    - Delicious easy to follow recipes that nourish your body and soul.
    - Workout videos for every level so you can move confidently & joyfully.
    - Mindfulness & wellness practices to calm your mind and centre your spirit.
    - A supportive community where we lift each other up, share wins, and grow together.

    My goal is simple: To inspire you to rise each day feeling balanced, strong, and empowered - body, mind, & heart. No extremes, no quick fixes, just sustainable habits & 
        a space to celebrate progress not perfection.
        Join me, explore, and lets rise to balance together!
