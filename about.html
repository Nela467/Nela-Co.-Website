        Hi Everyone!<br>
        I created Nela & Co, - Rise to Balance because I believe wellness is not about perfection - it is about connection, growth, and balance in every part of life.<br><br>
        This page is my little corner of the internet where health, mindfulness, and movement meet in a way that is real, practical, & uplifting.<br><br>
        Here you will find:<br>
        - Delicious easy to follow recipes that nourish your body and soul.<br>
        - Workout videos for every level so you can move confidently & joyfully.<br>
        - Mindfulness & wellness practices to calm your mind and centre your spirit.<br>
        - A supportive community where we lift each other up, share wins, and grow together.<br><br>
        My goal is simple: To inspire you to rise each day feeling balanced, strong, and empowered - body, mind, & heart. No extremes, no quick fixes, just sustainable habits & a space to celebrate progress not perfection.<br>
        Join me, explore, and let's rise to balance together!
